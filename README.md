This project investigates the relationship between inflation and employment indicators using real-world macroeconomic data.

The objective is to understand how rising prices affect the labor market, workforce stability, and real economic conditions.
The analysis focuses on identifying trends, correlations, and potential economic interpretations using statistical methods and data visualization.

This project simulates the work of a junior data analyst/economic analyst performing macroeconomic analysis for business or policy decision support.

Research Question

Does inflation influence employment levels and workforce dynamics?

Sub-questions:

Does higher inflation correlate with lower employment?

Is there a lagged effect between inflation changes and employment?

How does inflation affect real economic conditions?

Dataset

The dataset contains macroeconomic indicators collected from publicly available statistical sources.

Main variables:

Inflation rate (%)

Number of employees / employment rate

Time period (monthly or yearly observations)

Additional indicators (if applicable): wages, unemployment, CPI

The data was cleaned and prepared before analysis (missing values, formatting, numeric conversion).

Tools & Technologies

R Programming Language

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Statistical analysis

Correlation analysis

Data visualization

Libraries used may include:

tidyverse

ggplot2

dplyr

Methodology

Steps performed in the analysis:

Data import and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Trend visualization

Correlation analysis between inflation and employment

Interpretation of economic meaning

The analysis focuses not only on statistical results, but also on economic interpretation.

Key Findings (Example)

Inflation and employment show measurable interaction over time

Certain periods indicate delayed labor market response

Economic shocks affect employment stability

Macroeconomic indicators must be interpreted together, not independently

Visualizations

The project includes graphical analysis such as:

Time series plots

Trend comparisons

Correlation charts

These visualizations help explain complex economic relationships in an intuitive way.
